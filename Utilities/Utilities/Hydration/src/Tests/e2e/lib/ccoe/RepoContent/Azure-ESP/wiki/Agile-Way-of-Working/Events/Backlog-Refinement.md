# What

> Learn more about [Backlog Refinement](/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum/Events/Backlog-Refinement.md) in section [Learning resources](/Learning-resources.md)

[Backlog refinement](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/) (formerly known as backlog grooming) is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery. This activity occurs on a regular basis and may be an officially scheduled meeting or an ongoing activity.

# How

The goal of this session will be to discuss the Product Backlog Items that have been documented by the Product Owner and make sure that they are understood by the team and Ready to be planned for the coming Sprint. We will run Backlog Refinement sessions on a weekly basis following the conventions below:

1. The lead of the session will be the [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md).
2. All the team members need to attend and actively participate in the session.
3. The [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md) will explain to the rest of the team the User Story marked as Documented with the highest priority.
4. The entire team will make sure that the User Story follows what is defined in the [Definition of Ready](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md) for the User Story.
5. If the team agrees, the User Story is marked as Ready, and the team starts discussing the next User Story with highest priority. If the User Story needs more refinement, the [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md) will work on the User Story documentation and it will remain as "Documented".
