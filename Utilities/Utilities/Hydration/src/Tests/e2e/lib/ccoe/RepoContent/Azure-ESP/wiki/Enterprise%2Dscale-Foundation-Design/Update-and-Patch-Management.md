Cloud Native environment at contoso does not have any connection to on-premises infrastructure, where update and patch management processes are already in place. Solution with least infrastructure to manage from the CCOE Team perspective is to use PaaS service Azure Update Management.

contoso will leverage Azure native tooling and services to automate patch management for IaaS. The Update Management solution in Azure Automation is an option to manage operating system updates for Windows and Linux computers in Azure. 

The Patch Management solution for the Virtual Machin is described in [Virtual Machine](/Product-Catalog/Virtual-Machine)

For PaaS services, the Patch Management is provided in the service and contoso does not need to take care.
