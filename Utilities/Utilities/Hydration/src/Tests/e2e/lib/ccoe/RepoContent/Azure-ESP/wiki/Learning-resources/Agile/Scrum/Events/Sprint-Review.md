# Definition


[Sprint reviews](https://www.scrumalliance.org/about-scrum/events) focus on the product being development, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint. During a sprint review, the Scrum Team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the Sprint. They adapt the Product Backlog as needed based on this feedback. The Product Owner has the option to release any of the completed functionality.

Though a demo might be part of this meeting, the primary purpose of the Sprint Review is the inspect and adapt capability provided by the discussion.

The entire Scrum Team attends the sprint review. Any stakeholders, senior managers, and other affected departments (e.g., marketing, customer support) are invited to attend and give feedback. Scrum teams should invite as many people as the room can hold--diverse feedback is essential for creating excellent products.
