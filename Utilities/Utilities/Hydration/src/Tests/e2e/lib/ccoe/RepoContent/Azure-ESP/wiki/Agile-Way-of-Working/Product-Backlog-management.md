# Maintaining a healthy Product Backlog

> Learn about [Product Backlog](/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum/Product-Backlog.md) in section [Learning resources](/Learning-resources.md) 

The Product Backlog must remain populated with items that are relevant, detailed and estimated to a degree appropriate with their priority. Unlike a more formal "requirements document", the backlog is understood as a dynamic body of information.

To maintain a healthy Product Backlog, the Product Onwer must keep Product Backlog items with current understanding of the project or product and its objectives.

In our Way or Working, the Product Owner will continouosly maintain a Backlog up to date and understood by the entire Scrum Team:

1. Epics, Features and User Stories with enough level of detail as agreed in the [Definition of Ready](#definition-of-ready)
2. Acceptance criteria defined
3. User Stories [prioritized](#prioritization) accordingly
4. Updates communicated to the Scrum team in [Backlog Refinement](#backlog-refinement) sessions
5. Features grouped as part of a [Release Plan](#release-plan)

# Backlog refinement

[Backlog refinement](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/) (formerly known as backlog grooming) is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery.

- See how we run [Backlog Refinement sessions](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Backlog-Refinement.md)

# Definition of Ready

[Definition of Ready](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-ready/) is a set of agreements decided by the team that describes when a work item is ready to be worked on.

Definition of Ready avoids beginning work on features that do not have clearly defined completion criteria, which usually translates into costly back-and-forth discussion or rework. It also provides the team with an explicit agreement allowing it to “push back” on accepting ill-defined features to work on.

- See Definition of Ready for [Epics](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/Epic.md)

- See Definition of Ready for [User Stories](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md)

# Release Plan

Release Planning is one way we gather enough detail to do high-level planning. The release plan is a tool that allows for discussion to align targets, estimates, and joint commitments over a medium-long time range. The plan is reviewed at least quarterly in terms of Epics and Features (Stories are too granular).

How:
- Define a release goal and the project vision
- Select an iteration length, perform estimation and prioritization of user stories (there is always too much to do in too little time)
- Select features and a release date, use "what-if" questions to estimate delivered scope

# Prioritization

Items in Product Backlog must always have a priority, and the Product Owner is the the responsible of continuously setting a priority for the items in  the Product Backlog.

MoSCow prioritization based on Business Viability, Technical Feasibility and User Desirability combined with Design Thinking helps Product Owners identify what to work on first.
