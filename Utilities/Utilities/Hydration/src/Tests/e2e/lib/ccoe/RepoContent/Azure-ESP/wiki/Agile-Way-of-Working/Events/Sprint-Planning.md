# How

The goal of this session is to define the plan for the work to be delivered during the upcoming sprint. We will run Sprint Planning sessions following the conventions below:

1. At the beginning of the session, the [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md) will explain to the team the Sprint goal and the prioritized [User Stories](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md). After this introduction, the [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md) does not need to stay in the session.
2. The team will define who will play the [Scrum Master](/Who-we-are.md) role during the upcoming sprint, and the [Scrum master](/Who-we-are.md) will lead the rest of the session.
3. The [Scrum master](/Who-we-are.md) will move the prioritized [User Stories marked as Ready](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md) to the Sprint Backlog.
4. The team will discuss their capacity for the upcoming sprint (hours per day, vacations, leaves, etc.).
5. For each [User Story](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md) in scope, the team will discuss and create the required tasks to meet Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria.
6. For each [User Story](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md) that the team accepts to add to the sprint based on technical feasibility and available capacity, the [Scrum Master](/Who-we-are.md) will change the status to committed.
7. At the of the session, the [Scrum Master](/Who-we-are.md) will share the committed [User Stories](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md) with the [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md).
