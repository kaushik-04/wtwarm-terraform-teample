# What are the Scrum events?

![The Scrum Framework](/.attachments/images/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum/scrum-framework.png)

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process. The Scrum Events are:

- [Sprint](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint.md)
- [Sprint Planning](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Planning.md)
- [Daily Scrum](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Stand%2Dup-Meeting.md)
- [Sprint Review](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Review.md)
- [Sprint Retrospective](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Retrospective.md)

Another event needs to occur on a regular basis:
