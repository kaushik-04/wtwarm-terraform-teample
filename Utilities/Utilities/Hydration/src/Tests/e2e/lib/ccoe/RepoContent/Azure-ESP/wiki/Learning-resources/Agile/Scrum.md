# Scrum Introduction

Scrum is a framework used by teams to manage their work. Scrum implements the principles of [Agile](/Learning-resources/Agile.md) as a concrete set of artifacts, practices, and roles.

Following the Scrum framework, one begins by creating a *Product Backlog* – a prioritized list of features and other capabilities needed to develop a successful product. Guided by the Product Backlog, one always works on the most important or highest-priority items first. When one runs out of resources, such as time, any work that did not get completed will be of lower priority than the completed work.

The work itself is performed in short, *time-boxed iterations*, which usually range from a week to a calendar month length. During each iteration, a *self-organizing, cross-functional team* does all of the work – such as designing, building, and testing – required to produce completed, working features that could be put into production.

Typically, the amount of work in the *Product Backlog* is much greater than can be completed by a team in one short-duration iteration. So, at the start of each iteration, the team plans which *high-priority subset* of the Product Backlog to
create in the upcoming iteration.

At the end of the iteration, the team reviews the completed features with the stakeholders to get their feedback. Based on the feedback, the *Product Owner* and team can alter both what they plan to work on next and how the team plans to do the work. For example, if the stakeholders see a completed feature and then realize that another feature that they never considered must also be included in the product, the *Product Owner* can simply create a new item representing that feature and insert it into the *Product Backlog* in the correct order to be worked on in a future iteration.

At the end of each iteration, the team should have a *potentially shippable product* (or *increment of the product*), one that can be released if appropriate. If releasing after each iteration is not appropriate, a set of features from multiple iterations can be released together.

As each iteration ends, the whole process is begun anew with the planning of the next iteration.

# Scrum Sprint Cycle

*Figure 1: Scrum Sprint Cycle*

In the previous section, the general Scrum approach was introduced. *Figure 1* and the following paragraphs will put this general approach into a specific Sprint context by describing a typical Scrum Sprint Cycle. So, whereas the structure will sound familiar, important Scrum terminologies and their purpose are introduced.

As mentioned, *Figure 1* details the Scrum lifecycle. Scrum is iterative. The entire lifecycle is completed in a fixed time-period called *Sprint*. A Sprint is typically 1 to 4 weeks long.

The *Product Owner* has a vision of what he wants to create (the big cube). Because the cube can be large, through an activity called *Grooming* it is broken down into a set of features that are collected into a prioritized list called the *Product Backlog*.

A Sprint starts with *Sprint Planning*, encompasses the *Development Work* during the Sprint (called *Sprint Execution*), and ends with the *Sprint Review* and *Sprint Retrospective*. The Sprint is represented by the large, looping arrow that dominates the center of the figure. The number of items in the *Product Backlog* is likely to be more than a *Development Team* can complete on a short-duration Sprint. For that reason, at the beginning of each Sprint, the *Development Team* must determine a subset of the Product Backlog items it
believes it can complete – an activity called *Sprint Planning*, shown just to the right of the large *Product Backlog* cube.

To acquire confidence that the *Development Team* has made a reasonable commitment, the team members create a second backlog during *Sprint Planning*, called the *Sprint Backlog*. The *Sprint Backlog* describes, through a set of detailed *tasks*, how the team plans to design, build, integrate, and test the selected subset of features from the *Product Backlog* during that particular Sprint.

Next is *Sprint Execution*, where the *Development Team* performs the tasks necessary to realize the selected features. Each day during *Sprint Execution*, the team members help manage the flow of work by conducting a synchronization, inspection, and adaptive planning activity known as the *Daily Scrum*. At the end of *Sprint Execution*, the team has produced a *potentially shippable product increment* that represents some, but not all, of the *Product Owner’s* vision.

The Scrum team completes the Sprint by performing two *inspect-and-adapt* activities. In the first, called *Sprint Review*, the stakeholders and Scrum team inspect the product being built. In the second, called the *Sprint Retrospective*, the Scrum team inspects the Scrum process being used to create the product. The outcome of these activities might be adaptations that will make their way into the Product Backlog or be included as part of the team’s development process.

At this point, the Scrum Sprint Cycle repeats, beginning anew with the *Development Team* determining the next most important set of *Product Backlog* items it can complete. After an appropriate number of Sprints have been
completed, the *Product Owner’s* vision will be realized, and the solution can be released.

# Scrum Roles

> Learn more in section [Roles](/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum/Roles.md)

## Product Owner

The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for what the Development Team is building, and why it is building it. The PO is responsible for keeping the backlog up-to-date and in priority order. Generally, there exists one PO per Scrum team.

In a CCOE engagement, it is vital that the PO role is fulfilled by a customer representative.

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible to ensure the Scrum process is followed by the Development Team. Scrum Masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments that arise during a Sprint. Scrum Masters are partially coach, partially team member, and partially cheerleader. Generally, there exists one Scrum Master per Scrum team

## Development Team

The Development Team is formed by the individuals that actually build the product. The team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it. Generally, a Development Team consist of three to nine team members.

The PO, the Scum Master, and the Development Team, all roles together form a Scrum team.

# Product Backlog

> Learn more on section [Product Backlog](/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum/Product-Backlog.md)

The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of value the team can deliver. The Product Owner owns the Product Backlog and adds, changes, and reprioritizes as needed. The items at the top of the Product Backlog should always be ready for the team to execute on.

# Increment

The product of a Sprint is called the *Increment* or *Potentially Shippable Increment*. Regardless the term, a Sprint’s output should be of shippable quality, even if it is part of something bigger and cannot be shipped by itself. It should meet all the quality criteria set by the Development Team and Product Owner.

# Repeat – Learn – Improve

The entire cycle is repeated for upcoming Sprints. Sprint Planning selects the next items on the Product Backlog and the cycle repeats. While the team is executing the Sprint, the Product Owner is ensuring the items at the top of the backlog are ready to execute in the following Sprint.

This shorter, iterative cycle provides Development Teams with lots of opportunities to learn and improve. A traditional project often has a long lifecycle of approximately 6 to 12 months. While a Development Team can learn from a traditional project, the opportunities are far less than for a Development Team that executes in 1- to four-week Sprints.

Scrum is very popular because it provides just enough framework to guide teams, while giving them flexibility in how to execute. Its concepts are simple and easy to learn. Teams can get started quickly and learn as they go. All of this makes Scrum a great choice for teams just starting to implement Agile principles.

## Planning and Sprint Backlog

During Sprint Planning, the Development Team chooses the Product Backlog items they will work on in the upcoming Sprint. The Development Team chooses Product Backlog items based on their assigned priority and what they believe they can complete in a Sprint. Often, each item on the Sprint Backlog is broken down into Tasks. Once all members agree the Sprint Backlog is achievable, the Sprint starts.

## Sprint Execution and Daily Scrum

Once a Sprint starts, the Development Team executes on the Sprint Backlog. Scrum does not specify how the Development Team should execute. That is left for the Development Team to decide.

Scrum defines a practice called a Daily Scrum, often called the Daily Stand-up. The Daily Scrum is a daily meeting limited to 15 minutes. The Development Team members often stand during the meeting, to ensure it stays brief. Each Development Team member briefly reports their progress since yesterday, the plans for today, and anything impeding their progress. Detailed discussions should be held separately from the Daily Scrum and can hence be followed up with at any point after the Daily Scrum.

To aid the Daily Scrum, teams often review two artifacts: (1) the Task Board and (2) the Sprint Burndown. The Task Board lists each Sprint Backlog item the team is working on, broken down into the tasks required to complete it. Tasks are placed in *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done* columns based on their status. It provides a visual way of tracking progress for each Sprint Backlog item. The Sprint Burndown is a graph that plots the daily total of remaining work. Remaining work is typically in hours. It provides a visual way of showing whether the team is on track to complete all the work by the end of the Sprint.

# Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective

At the end of the Sprint, the team performs two practices: (1) Sprint Review and (2) Sprint Retrospective. During the Sprint Review, the Development Team demonstrates what they have accomplished to stakeholders. They demo their Sprint achievements, e.g., a function of software, and outline its value. In the Sprint Retrospective, the Development Team takes time to reflect on what went well and which areas need improvement. The outcome of the Sprint Retrospective are actions for the next Sprint.
