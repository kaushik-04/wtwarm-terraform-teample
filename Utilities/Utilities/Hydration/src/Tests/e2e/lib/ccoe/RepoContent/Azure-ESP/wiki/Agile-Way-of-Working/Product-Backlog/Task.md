# Conventions

Breaking the user story down into tasks helps the team determine how they'll approach the story. By getting into this level of detail, any unknowns will be uncovered. During the planning session, the Team will collaboratively work to create the tasks required to meet both Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done of the committed User Stories. We will avoid too much detail in tasks to avoid overhead, but we will follow the same guidelines to keep consistency:
- We will try to keep tasks small enough that they can be done in a day or less
- Task should be created and agreed by the team at the beginning of the Sprint in the [Sprint Planning](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Planning.md) session but creating new Tasks during the Sprint is accepted
- Tasks will be used to discuss progress during the [Stand Up meeting](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Stand%2Dup-Meeting.md)
