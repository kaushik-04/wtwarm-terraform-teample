[Sprint reviews](https://www.scrumalliance.org/about-scrum/events) focus on the product being development, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint. During a sprint review, the Scrum Team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the Sprint. They adapt the Product Backlog as needed based on this feedback. The Product Owner has the option to release any of the completed functionality. 

Though a demo might be part of this meeting, the primary purpose of the Sprint Review is the inspect and adapt capability provided by the discussion.

The entire Scrum Team attends the sprint review. Any stakeholders, senior managers, and other affected departments (e.g., marketing, customer support) are invited to attend and give feedback. Scrum teams should invite as many people as the room can hold--diverse feedback is essential for creating excellent products.

# How

We will run Sprint Review sessions following the conventions below:
- At the beginning of the session, the [Product Owner](/Who-we-are.md) will explain to the attendants the Sprint goal and the prioritized [User Stories](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md).
- The [Scrum master](/Who-we-are.md) will explain one by one the Acceptance Criteria of each User Story committed for the sprint.
- The team will demo how the Acceptance Criteria were met with supporting explanations.
- At the end of the session, the [Scrum master](/Who-we-are.md) will gather feedback from the attendees.
