# What is Azure PowerShell?

[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps?view=azps-4.4.0) is designed for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line. Use Azure PowerShell when you want to build automated tools that use the Azure Resource Manager model. 

Starting in December 2018, the [Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) is in general release and is now the intended PowerShell module for interacting with Azure. Az offers shorter commands, improved stability, and cross-platform support. Az also has feature parity with AzureRM, giving you an easy migration path.
