# What is Agile?

[Agile](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-product-delivery/) Product Delivery is a customer-centric approach to defining, building, and releasing a continuous flow of valuable products and services to customers and users.

Agile planning is a practice that requires planners, architects and agile teams to integrate their plans across the enterprise on an on-going basis, flowing feedback, new ideas and requirements into a multi layered Kanban system for refinement, decomposition and prioritization.

The [manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for Agile Software Development is about delivering software. It’s about *software development*, not project management, not design. It involves those things, but it’s the heart of Continuous Planning and DevOps:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

# Why Agile?

In traditional waterfall approaches we need to understand everything upfront and have a perfect and detailed plan. Details are great, but you not all the details are needed for the entire product. Waterfall is costly in time and money because of the time spent analyzing every detail.

In static planning, you fix the scope and determine how much time the scope will take and how much it will cost to produce a product of a certain quality. With Agile Planning you learn that time is fixed to meet business objectives, the only thing that is negotiable is scope.

Although Waterfall and Agile are both challenged, Agile just so [happens to be successful 30% more of the time](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf).

# How we do Agile?

## Scrum

> Learn more in section [Scrum](/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum.md)

We will follow the [Scrum framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum). 

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. 

Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.
