# Definition

A [Sprint](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/iteration/) is a timebox during which development takes place, the duration of which:

- may vary from project to project, usually between 1 and 4 weeks
- is in most cases fixed for the duration of a given project

A key feature of Scrum approaches is the underlying assumption that a project consists excusively of a sprints of iterations, possibly with the exception of a very brief “vision and planning” phase prior to development, and a similarly brief “closure” phase after it.

In general sprints are aligned with calendar weeks, often starting on mondays and ending on fridays; this is more a matter of convenience than an explicit recommendation and many teams adopt different conventions.

The fixed length of sprints gives teams a simple way to obtain, based on velocity and the amount of work remaining, a usually accurate (though not very precise) estimation of the project’s remaining duration.
