We will use an [Agile](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-product-delivery/) as our customer-centric approach to defining, building, and releasing a continuous flow of value to our users. We will follow the [Scrum framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum).

Scrum is an Agile framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. 

Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.

## The Scrum Team

> See members of our Scrum Team in section [Who we are](/Who-we-are.md)

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams are **self-organizing** and **cross-functional**. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

## Product Backlog

The [Product Backlog](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-backlog) is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

The Product Backlog for our work will be defined in three different levels.
- The **[Epic](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/Epic.md)** level.
- The **[Feature](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/Feature.md)** level.
- The **[User Story](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/User-Story.md)** level.

In order to maintain a healthy and understandable backlog, as a team we must agree on the following aspects for each item in the backlog:
- [Definition of Ready](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-ready/) is used to assess if Product Backlog Items (PBI's) are "ready for Sprint"
- [Definition of Done](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/), which is a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment can be considered “done”.
- [Acceptance Criteria](https://dzone.com/articles/acceptance-criteria-in-software-explanation-exampl), which is a formal list that fully enumerates user requirements and all the product scenarios put into the account.

## Events

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process. The Scrum Events are:

- [Sprint](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint.md)
- [Sprint Planning](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Planning.md)
- [Daily Scrum](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Stand%2Dup-Meeting.md)
- [Sprint Review](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Review.md)
- [Sprint Retrospective](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Retrospective.md)

Another event needs to occur on a regular basis:

- [Product Backlog refinement](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Backlog-Refinement.md)
