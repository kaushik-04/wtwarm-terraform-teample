A [Sprint](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/iteration/) is a timebox during which development takes place, the duration of which:

- may vary from project to project, usually between 1 and 4 weeks
- is in most cases fixed for the duration of a given project

A key feature of Agile approaches is the underlying assumption that a project consists exclusively of a sprints of iterations, possibly with the exception of a very brief “vision and planning” phase prior to development, and a similarly brief “closure” phase after it.

In general sprints are aligned with calendar weeks, often starting on mondays and ending on fridays; this is more a matter of convenience than an explicit recommendation and many teams adopt different conventions.

The fixed length of sprints gives teams a simple way to obtain, based on velocity and the amount of work remaining, a usually accurate (though not very precise) estimation of the project’s remaining duration.

# How

We will run Sprints following the conventions below:
- We will do Sprints of 3 weeks
- The last and first day of the Sprint will be on Thursday
- We will end Sprints by running [Sprint Reviews](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Review.md) and [Sprint Retrospectives](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Retrospective.md)
- We will start Sprints by running a [Sprint Planning](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Planning.md) session
- During the Sprint, we will have [Backlog Refinement](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Backlog-Refinement.md) sessions on a weekly basis
