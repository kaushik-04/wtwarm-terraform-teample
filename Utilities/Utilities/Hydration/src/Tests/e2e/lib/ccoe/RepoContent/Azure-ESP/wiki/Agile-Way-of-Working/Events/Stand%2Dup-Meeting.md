> Learn about [Stand-up meeting](/Learning-resources/Agile/Scrum/Events/Stand%2Dup-Meeting.md) in section [Learning resources](/Learning-resources.md)

[Each day at the same time](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/), the team meets so as to bring everyone up to date on the information that is vital for coordination: each team members briefly describes any “completed” contributions and any obstacles that stand in their way. Usually, Scrum's Three Questions are used to structure discussion. The meeting is normally held in front of the task board.

This meeting is normally timeboxed to a maximum duration of 15 minutes, though this may need adjusting for larger teams. To keep the meeting short, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short, added to a “parking lot” list, and discussed in greater depth after the meeting, between the people affected by the issue.

# How

We will run Stand-up Meetings following the conventions below:
- each team member briefly describes:
  - What he or she did the previous day to help achieve the sprint goal
  - What he or she planned today to help achieve the sprint goal
  - The impediments he or she found that may jeopardize the sprint goal
