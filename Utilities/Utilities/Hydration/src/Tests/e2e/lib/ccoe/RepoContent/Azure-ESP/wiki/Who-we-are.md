# Who we are

We form a self-organizing, cross-functional team that focus in all aspects of the work – such as designing, building, and testing – required to produce completed, working Azure Platform and components that provide autonomy and compliance to other teams in our organization, according to our [Vision](/Welcome.md).

Our team counts on the following roles:
- The **Product Owner (PO)**, who is responsible for what the team is building, and why it is building it. The Product Owner, supported by other members of the team, is responsible for keeping the backlog up-to-date and in priority order.
- **Agile development Team members**, who are the individuals that actually build the product. The team owns the engineering of the product, and the quality that goes with it.
- A **rotating Scrum Master**, responsible to ensure the Scrum process is followed by the entire team. Scrum Masters are continually on the lookout for how the team can improve, while also resolving impediments that arise during a Sprint.
