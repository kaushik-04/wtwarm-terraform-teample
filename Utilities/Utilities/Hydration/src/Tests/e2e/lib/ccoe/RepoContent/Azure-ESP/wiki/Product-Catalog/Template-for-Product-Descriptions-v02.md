All product-specific security controls - for the current product version - can be found on the table below (and with additional guidelines [here](https://dev.azure.com/contoso-azure/building-blocks/_wiki/wikis/Wiki/473/Cloud-Native-Security-Controls)):

| Index | Security Requirements | Relevance | Implementation details  | Policy Enforced / Audit | Design Status  | Implementation Status |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CN-SR-01 | Use a secure protocol to encrypt data at transfer (Preferably TLS1.2 or later).  | |   |  |  |
| CN-SR-02 | Secret and Key management needs to be done by a dedicated database/vault.  |   |   |   |  |
| CN-SR-03 | Encrypt information at rest (Disc encryption).  |  |   |  |  |
| CN-SR-04 | Maintain an inventory of sensitive Information.  |   |   |   |  |
| CN-SR-05 | Use an active discovery tool to identify sensitive data.  |  |   |   |  |
| CN-SR-06 | Protect the database from permanently deleting data by enabling soft delete functionality.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-07 | Ensure regular automated back ups  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-08 | Enforce the use of Azure Active Directory.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-09 | Follow the principle of least privilege.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-10 | Configure security log storage retention.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-11 | Enable alerts for anomalous activity.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-12 | Configure central security log management.Â   |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-13 | Enable audit logging of Azure Resources.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-14 | Enable MFA and conditional access with MFA.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-15 | Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-16 | Ensure that the endpoint protection for all Virtual Machines is installed.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-17 | Secure outbound communication to the internet.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-18 | Enable JIT network access.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-19 | Run automated vulnerability scanning tools.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-20 | Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-21 | Disable remote user access ports (RDP,SSH,Telnet,FTP).  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-22 | Enable automated Patching/ Upgrading.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-23 | Enable transparent data encryption.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-24 | Enable OS vulnerabilities recommendations.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-25 | Configure firewall rules of existing firewalls if necessary.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-26 | Enable command-line audit logging.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-27 | Enable conditional access control.  |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-28 | Specify service tags to define network access controls on network security groups or Azure Firewall. |  |  |   |  |
| CN-SR-29 | Use Corporate Active Directory Credentials.  |  |  |   |  |
