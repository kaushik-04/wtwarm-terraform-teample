## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Service Description
Azure Container Instances offers a simple way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage virtual machines and having to adopt a higher-level service.

Azure Container Instances is a great solution for a scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.

In this version of the Certified Service, the Azure Container Instances can be deployed to schedule both Windows and Linux containers with the same API. 

Some features are currently restricted to Linux containers:

- Multiple containers per container group
- Volume mounting (Azure Files, emptyDir, GitRepo, secret)
- Resource usage metrics with Azure Monitor
- Virtual network deployment


## 2.      Architecture


### 2.1. High Level Design
The following figure describes the overall architecture for this service:

![aci_architecture.png](/.attachments/aci_architecture-cac8269d-0736-489b-a806-4c4aca2d369c.png)

### 2.2. Consumption endpoints (Data plane)
Container groups can share an external-facing IP address, one or more ports on that IP address, and a DNS label with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). To enable external clients to reach a container within the group, the port on the IP address and from the container must expose.
| Consumption Endpoint (Data plane) | Port
| - | -
| https://{serviceName}.{region}.azurecontainer.io | 443


#### 2.2.1. Endpoint Access

The service will be deployed as a public endpoint allowing traffic from the Internet; access limited by authentication. This way we ensure that any external service access to this resource.

#### 2.2.2. Endpoint Authorization and Authentication
Azure Container Instances is a PaaS service and protected through RBAC rules.
Note: The service is hosting container images where Developers must ensure that only privileged users can access those containers in transit and at rest! 
Containers can spread across several clusters and Azure regions. Inventory all credential secrets, and require developers to use emerging secrets-management tools that are designed for container platforms. 

**RBAC Authorization**: 

| Role/Permission | Prod | Non-Prod| Description | 
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Reader          | X          |  | Can be assigned to end-users who should be able to view service configuration.                                               |
| Contributor |         |   X                   | Can be assigned to developers who should be able to modify service configuration. |
| Owner |          X              |   X                   | Can be assigned to entities (service principals / managed identities) that need to create instances.                             |



### 2.3. Service Limits

All Azure services include certain default limits and quotas for resources and features. Availability of compute, memory, and storage resources for Azure Container Instances varies by region and operating system. [For details, see Resource availability for Azure Container Instances.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quotas)

Use the List Usage API to review current quota usage in a region for a subscription.


### 2.4. Monitoring

Take advantage of solutions to scan container images in a private registry and identify potential vulnerabilities. Itâ€™s important to understand the depth of threat detection that the different solutions provide.

Azure Container Registry optionally integrates with Azure Security Center to automatically scan all Linux images pushed to a registry. Azure Security Center's integrated Qualys scanner detects image vulnerabilities, classifies them, and provides remediation guidance.

Security monitoring and image scanning solutions such as Twistlock and Aqua Security are also available through the Azure Marketplace.

Some best practices for monitoring are:
- Enable monitoring across all web apps and services: this way, you can easily visualize end-to-end transactions and connections across all components.
- Setup actionable alerts with notifications and/or remediation: Having a robust alerting pipeline is essential for any monitoring strategy and it is recommended to set up actionable alerts for all predictable failure states.
- Prepare role-based dashboards and workbooks for reporting.


## 3. Service Provisioning

## 6. Implemented Policies

This section describes the policies which will be implemented for Container Registry.
These policies will be assigned when deploying a Container Registry or when deploying a Subcription/Management Group, this separation will be discussed below.

| Policy | Description | Implementation Scope
|--|--|--|
|Enforce SKUs policy|This policy restrict the SKUs you can specify when deploying Container Registry|Subscription |
|Collect Activity Logs with Azure Monitor and send it to Log Analytics and Event Hub| This policy checks whether the Container Instance Logs are collected with Azure Monitor and send to Log analytics workspace and Event Hub | Deployed on each Subscription or Management group with the relevant Ids|
|Disable Admin user| This policy checks whether the ACR admin user is disabled|Deployed on each Subscription or Management group with the relevant Ids|
