# Conventions

[Tagging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items?view=azure-devops) work items help teams quickly filter the product backlog or a work item query by categories defined by the team. A tag corresponds to a one or two keyword phrase that you define and that supports your needs to filter a backlog or query, or define a query.
We will use the following tags:

| Category | Purpose | Values |
| - | - | - |
