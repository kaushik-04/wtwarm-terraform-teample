[[_TOC_]]

# Conventions

We will use User Stories to define the specific work that needs to be done to produce an increment of the related [Feature](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/Feature.md).

User Stories must fit into any Sprint, and the increment must be shown in a demo during the [Sprint Review](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Sprint-Review.md) session.

A good user story should follow the [INVEST](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/invest.html) formula:
- "I"ndependent (of all others)
- "N"egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- "V"aluable (or vertical)
- "E"stimable (to a good approximation)
- "S"mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
- "T"estable (in principle, even if there isnâ€™t a test for it yet)

The User Stories will be detailed with the following Work Item attributes:

| Attribute | Description
| - | -
| Title | The title of the User Story to enable. It describes *what* needs to be done with a short sentence that is extended in the description
| Tags | One or more of the agreed [tags](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Product-Backlog/Tags.md) related for this User Story 
| Description | The description of the User Story will follow the convention *"To achieve [why: reason/value], as a [who: persona] I want [what: increment to produce]"*. More details can be added to the User Story when needed
| State | One of the following [states](https://dev.azure.com/contoso-MS/_settings/process?process-name=ACF%20Process&type-id=Microsoft.VSTS.WorkItemTypes.UserStory&_a=states):<ul><li>**New**.

The User Story has been documented by the Product Owner, but it needs hasn't be discussed yet with the team in a [Backlog Refinement Session](/Agile-Way-of-Working/Events/Backlog-Refinement.md)</li><li>**Ready**.
