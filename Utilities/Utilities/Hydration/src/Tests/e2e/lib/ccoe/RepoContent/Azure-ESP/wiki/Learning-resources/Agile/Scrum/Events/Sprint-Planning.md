# Definition

[Sprint planning](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/sprint-planning/) is an event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items.

Teams may find it helpful to establish a sprint goal and use that as the basis by which they determine which product backlog items they work on during that sprint.

Sprint planning typically involves the entire team:

- A product owner identifies the candidate product backlog items and their relative priorities, as well as proposes a sprint goal.
- The team members determine how many of the product backlog items they forecast they will be able to complete and determine how they will deliver those product backlog items.
- A scrum master or coach typically facilitates sprint planning in order to ensure that the discussion is effective and that there is agreement to the sprint goal and that the appropriate product backlog items are included in the sprint backlog.

# Expected Benefits

The main benefit of sprint planning is that it allows a team to start a new sprint with a shared understanding of what they will work on for that sprint, as well as an initial plan for how they approach that work.

# Common pitfalls

Sprint planning can become ineffective when your team does not have a properly refined product backlog from which to draw product backlog items. If you find yourself in this situation you inevitably have to spend time during sprint planning developing a better understanding of the product backlog items, which may include splitting stories, and estimating.

You can address this issue by establishing a consistent backlog refinement process that results in a set of product backlog items that meet an agreed to definition of ready. Those ready product backlog items can then serve as the potential product backlog items you consider for inclusion in the sprint.

Another issue arises when you don’t establish a specific goal for the sprint and wind up with a set of unrelated items that the team has to work on. This can result in your team performing a sprints worth of work but not feeling as though they’ve made a lot of progress.
